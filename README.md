# Optimized architecture

## This workshop is archived and is no longer being maintained. Content is read-only.   

Contoso has recently completed a migration to shift most its enterprise data center footprint to the cloud. "The cloud is the future, and as such, it is essential for us to proactively adopt the cloud before our competitors to remain innovative and as competitive as possible," says Emma Lowton, Chief Technology Officer. "Unfortunately, due to our limited expertise in cloud computing, I have grown concerned that our Azure spending is much higher than it should be."

## Target audience

- Infrastructure Architect
- Application Developer

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to optimize a lift-and-shift style Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) architecture in Azure to improve cost savings. You will also compare IaaS and PaaS (Platform as a service) hosting options to save cost even further using Azure App Service. Additionally, you will learn to improve resiliency and high availability through multi-region deployment.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design and implement a plan to optimize Azure IaaS and PaaS deployments, compare costs between Azure IaaS versus Azure PaaS, setup SQL Database geo-replication, and configure multi-region deployments.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will review how to size and optimize a migrated workload to Azure Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). From there, you will consider the cost and benefit of optimizing the solution using Azure Platform as a service (PaaS) services and then design and price the optimized solution.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design and plan for optimizing Azure IaaS and PaaS deployments, price solutions using the Azure calculator, and setup multi-region solutions.

### Hands-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will determine the appropriate hosting tiers for the Contoso Financial application and estimate the total cost savings on a monthly and annual basis. You will implement and integrate Azure Traffic Manager, then migrate the Web, API and Background App Tiers of the application to the Azure App Service. Next, you will then de-commission the old application infrastructure, and setup geo-replication for the Azure SQL Database in preparation for the next step, which is deploying a European instance of the Web App Tier. Finally, you will add an endpoint for this new Web App Tier to the Azure Traffic Manager.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement optimization of Azure IaaS and PaaS deployments, price solutions using the Azure calculator, and setup multi-region solutions.
