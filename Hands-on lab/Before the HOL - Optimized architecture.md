# Optimized architecture before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription

2.  Local machine or a virtual machine configured with Visual Studio
    2017 Community Edition or better

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up an environment to use for the rest of
the exercises.

### Task 1: Create a virtual machine for your lab environment 

1.  Launch a browser using incognite or in-private mode, and navigate to
    <https://portal.azure.com>. Once prompted, login with your Microsoft
    Azure credentials. If prompted, choose whether your account is an
    organization account or just a Microsoft Account.

2.  Click **+ Create a resource**, and in the search box, type in Visual Studio
    Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64), and press enter. Click
    the Visual Studio Community 2017 image running on Windows Server
    2016 and with the latest update.

3.  In the returned search results, click the image name

    ![In the Everything blade, Visual Studio Community 2017 is typed in
    the Search field. Under Name, Visual Studio Community on Windows
    Server 2016 is
    circled.](images/Setup/image3.png "Everything blade")

4.  In the Marketplace solution blade, click **Create**

5.  Set the following configuration on the Basics tab, and click **OK**:

    -   Name: **LABVM**

    -   VM disk type: **SSD**

    -   User name: **demouser**

    -   Password: **demo@pass123**

    -   Subscription: **If you have multiple subscriptions choose the
        subscription to execute your labs in**

    -   Resource Group: **OPSLABRG**

    -   Location: **Choose the closest Azure region to you**

6.  Choose the **DS1\_V2 Standard** instance size on the Size blade

7.  Accept the remaining default values on the Settings blade, and click
    **OK**. On the Summary page, click **OK**. The deployment should
    begin provisioning. It may take more than 10 minutes for the virtual
    machine to complete provisioning.

    <https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/optimized-architecture/OptimizedArchitecture-StudentFiles-6-2017.zip>.

3.  Right click on the downloaded .zip file, and click **Properties**.
    On the properties pane, check **Unblock** to ensure the files are
    marked safe.

    -   Resource group location: **North Central US (note if your
        subscription allows this otherwise pick up subscription where
        you are allowed to deploy to)**

        ![Fields in the Create Resource Group dialog box are set to the
        previously defined
        settings.](images/Setup/image12.png "Create Resource Group dialog box")

6.  Click the **Create** button

    button to deploy the ARM Template to the newly created Resource
    Group

    ![In the Deploy to Resource Group dialog box, the Deploy button is
    selected.](images/Setup/image13.png "Deploy to Resource Group dialog box")

8.  Deployment status of the ARM Template will be displayed in the
    **Output** window within Visual Studio

    ![Deployment status displays in the Visual Studio Output
    Window.](images/Setup/image14.png "Visual Studio Output Window")

9.  Once the deployment has completed successfully, the **IP Address**
    and **FQDN** of the External / Internet Load Balancer for the Web
    App tier will be displayed in the output window

    ![The IP Address for the External / Internal Load Balancer are
    circled in the Output
    Window.](images/Setup/image15.png "Output Window")

> The **Username** and **Password** for the VMs and SQL Database created
by the ARM Template are:
> - Username: **demouser**
> - Password: demo@pass123

10.  Open a new **Web Browser** window, and navigate to the Web App tier
    using the **Internet Load Balancer IP Address**
    
   ![The Contoso Financial Login webpage
    displays.](images/Setup/image16.png "Contoso Financial Login webpage")

11.  To login to the Web App Tier of the Contoso Financial sample
    application, simply enter **any email address and password**
    followed by clicking on **Sign in**. If you can't immediately sign
    in, give the site a few minutes to run the background process and
    then attempt to sign in again.

12.  Once logged in, the sample application will display a simple
    **Account Transaction** ledger
    
   ![The Contoso Financial Account Overview webpage displays with
    Transaction details in an account transaction
    ledger.](images/Setup/image17.png "Contoso Financial Account Overview webpage")

Leaving the browser open to the Account Overview page will automatically
load new transactions as they are generated by the background process,
since the web page has a JavaScript timer that checks for new
transactions periodically. 

You should follow all steps provided **before** attending the
HOL.
