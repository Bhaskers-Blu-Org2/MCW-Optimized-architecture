# Optimized Architecture

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to optimize a lift and shift
style IaaS architecture in Azure to improve cost savings. You will also
compare IaaS and PaaS hosting options to save cost even further using
Azure App Service. Additionally, you will learn to improve
resiliency and high availability through multi-region deployment.

Attendees will learn how to:

-   Optimize Azure IaaS for cost savings

-   Migrate an Azure IaaS optimized

-   Compare cost between Azure IaaS versus Azure PaaS

-   Setup SQL Database geo-replication

-   Configure multi-region deployment

### Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will review how to size and optimize a migrated workload to Azure infrastructure as a service. From there, you will consider the cost and benefit of optimizing the solution using Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) services and then design and price the optimized solution

### Hand-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will determine the appropriate hosting tiers for the Contoso Financial application
and estimate the total cost savings on a monthly and annual basis. Then, you will implement
and integrate Azure Traffic Manager. You will then migrate the Web, API and Background App Tiers of the application to the Azure App Service. You will then de-commission the old application infrastructure. Then, you will setup geo-replication for the Azure SQL Database in preparation for the next step, which is deploying an European instance of the Web App Tier. Finally, you will add an endpoint for this new Web App Tier to the Azure Traffic Manager.
