<h3 id="customer-situation">Customer situation</h3>
<p>Contoso Financial Inc. is one of the fastest growing financial organizations in the United States. With its corporate headquarters in Chicago, IL, the company has grown to over 1,000 employees. Most employees work from one of the regional offices strategically located in all the major United States cities. However, many of the employees work remotely either daily or even after hours.</p>
<p>Contoso has recently completed a migration to shift most its enterprise data center footprint to the cloud. “The cloud is the future, and as such, it is essential for us to proactively adopt the cloud before our competitors to remain innovative and as competitive as possible,” says Emma Lowton, Chief Technology Officer. “Unfortunately, due to our limited expertise in cloud computing, I have grown concerned that our Azure spending is much higher than it should be.”</p>
<p>The migration process performed by Contoso used the “Lift and shift” method to move their existing workloads into Microsoft Azure. Their current Azure usage is dependent on the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) services in addition to the adoption of Azure Active Directory (AD) and Office 365. So far, they have not used the Platform as a Service (PaaS) services very much except for Azure Storage and Azure Service Bus Queue, which replaced MSMQ.</p>
<p>Last year, Contoso completed the acquisition of the European based Lucerne Ltd. With the acquisition complete, a deadline was set to begin migrating all Lucerne employees to the Contoso systems within 18 months. The Chief Executive Office, Jay Calvin’s biggest concern with the existing architecture is, “With concerns about spending too much, I am very concerned we will not be able to stay competitive, as we onboard the Lucerne employees over to use Contoso systems.”</p>
<p>The company has over 120 workloads migrated to running in Microsoft Azure. Only a small number of these are considered mission critical. Ultimately, all the workloads will need to be optimized for reduced Azure spending without compromising system resiliency and reliability. The Contoso’s IT Operations team has identified a single mission critical workload that consists of a 3-tier web application with a SQL Server database. After optimization has been proven with this single application, plans will be laid to perform similar cost optimizations across their entire cloud footprint.</p>
<p>It has already been identified that the existing Azure architecture has been overprovisioned for the workload. The existing architecture within Azure needs to be modified to match more closely with the workload demand and use some of the cloud features of Azure that allow for greater cost savings. In addition to reducing cost, the architecture also needs to be optimized to be able to handle Contoso’s future growth, even after Lucerne employees have been onboarded.</p>
<p><strong>Existing architecture</strong></p>
<p>Percy Bowman is the Director of IT Operations and manages the team responsible for maintaining the enterprise systems. Percy is concerned that “the current architecture is much too difficult to maintain over time with all of the manual operations necessary, especially as the company continues to grow and expand into Europe.” The existing architecture is made up of multiple virtual machines that need to be fully managed and maintained by Contoso today. As the company continues to grow, the system needs to be able to scale more easily, as adding more VMs over time will eventually lead to prohibitive costs. It is the primary reason the Contoso enterprise workloads were migrated into the cloud in the first place.</p>
<p>The system is broken out into three tiers (Front-end Web App, Back-end Web API, Back-end Processing) and a Microsoft SQL Server database server. The VM count for the different tiers remains the same as when the system was hosted on-premises since they performed a straight “Lift and shift” to move into Azure. The Web App and Web API tiers are made up of three VMs each. Both the Web App and Web API tiers use an Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic across the redundant VMs. The Back-end Processing tier is made up of two VMs for redundancy, with the additional benefit of meeting the SLA uptime guarantee.</p>
<p>The Front-end Web App and Back-end Web API tiers are hosted on Windows Server 2012 R2 using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The server-side application code for the Front-end Web App tier is written in C# using ASP.NET MVC 5. The application code for the Back-end Web API tier is written in C# using ASP.NET Web API and uses Entity Framework to communicate with the SQL Server database.</p>
<p>The Back-end Processing tier is hosted on Windows Server 2012 R2 with the application code written as a C# Console Application. The Back-end Processing tier receives messages of work to be done from the Back-end Web API tier using an Azure Service Bus Queue.</p>
<p>The database server is somewhat of a problem area with the current architecture. During the migration, the production Pilot environment was setup in the Azure West US region. When the final production environment was built out, it was determined the Azure North Central US region would be used to better serve users and be located geographically closer to the corporate headquarters. The database server is running Microsoft SQL Server 2014, and is hosted on a single VM. So far, the overall necessary performance demand has been met, but the database server lacks redundancy. The way it is hosted was only meant to be temporary when going live into full production. However, in the rush to put out other production fires at the time of “Go Live”, the Production Pilot VM for the database server stayed in place. According to Percy Bowman, Directory of IT Operations, “the database server has not failed us yet, but we know this setup is less than ideal. Although, we do keep backups in the event of a failure.”</p>

<p><strong>Existing virtual machine utilization</strong></p>
<p>The Contoso IT Operations team decided to standardize on the “Standard D3” VM instance size (4 cores, 14GB RAM) for the Front-end and Back-end tiers using Standard storage. The SQL Server database server VM needs more resources so it is configured to use the “Standard GS4” VM instance size (16 cores, 224GB RAM).</p>
<p>Contoso IT Operations team does use some third-party tools to aggregate server metrics for simplified reporting and monitoring processes. However, the primary method they used to gather the CPU and RAM utilization of the specific workload to target was to sign in to the Azure Portal and access Azure’s VM monitoring within the Virtual Machine blade. They gathered both the “CPU percentage” and “Memory usage” statistics to get average CPU and RAM utilization percentages for the virtual machines.</p>
<p>The average CPU and RAM usage of the servers during normal business hours (8AM – 5PM, Monday through Friday) and the estimated cost per VM is as follows:</p>

The third row is Back-end processing tier, which is CPU of 49 percent, and RAM of 25 percent. The bottom row, Database Server SQL Database: Preium P4, has no CPU or RAM information." /><figcaption>In this Standard D3 pricing tier, the first row is Front-End Web App Tier, which offers CPU of 36 percent and RAM of 46 percent, or CPU of 38 percent or RAM of 44 percent.

<p><strong>Database usage analysis</strong></p>
<p>One of the Database Administrators at Contoso, Naina Dhyani, has completed some additional performance profiling to help determine how to optimize the SQL Server VM. Using the production server, Naina captured performance metrics and used the Azure SQL Database DTU Calculator to determine the estimated DTU (data through-put unit) requirements of the SQL Server VM. According to Naina, “It gave me the result that our database requires about 400 DTUs. I am really not sure what a DTU is, but I know Azure SQL Databases use that for billing.”</p>

<li><p>Reducing the overall spending on Azure is great, but how will we ensure costs remain optimized?</p></li>
<li><p>If we drastically change the overall architecture, will we be able to migrate it without taking it down for a week?</p></li>
<li><p>Our operations team is new to the cloud and Microsoft Azure. While we are comfortable using the IaaS services, we are concerned that PaaS services will be difficult to monitor and maintain when mixed with IaaS services in our overall environment.</p></li>
<li><p>We are concerned that the system performance for the European users will not be as good as it needs to be. In the past, we have had employees work while traveling and the system was slow for them.</p></li>
<li><p>The VM sizes currently used appear to be more than we need, but how can we determine what the appropriate sizes should be?</p></li>
<li><p>We have already purchased SQL Server and other product licenses. I am worried the savings from optimizing spending using Azure PaaS services will not be significant to be worth it.</p></li>
